# Git Aware bash Prompt

This prompt is a port of Yuji Kosugi GitHub Gist https://gist.github.com/yujily/1144329 and made it my own.

The changes I made were:

* kept original prompt, only adding the branch name when in a Git repo
* kept terminal theme colors for prompt, except for the branch name

## Intallation

1. Clone repo anywhere you want
2. Copy the file ``.bash_prompt_git_aware`` to your homedir
3. Source the file ``.bash_prompt_git_aware`` from your ``~/.bash_profile`` or ``~/.bashrc`` file.
4. Open Terminal and navigate to any Git repo
